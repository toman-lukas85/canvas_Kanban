| **Harness for PCF (PowerApps Component Framework) controls** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |

## Overview

This package contains the scripts required to test and debug a custom PowerApps Component Framework (PCF) control for Microsoft PowerApps on your local development PC.
The scripts are designed to be used in conjunction with the Microsoft Power Platform CLI tool, which is separately available via an MSI installer.

Please visit the publicly available [documentation for the Microsoft Power Platform CLI tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/component-framework/create-custom-controls-using-pcf) to learn more.
You can also install the Power Platform CLI via our pac CLI [VS Code extension](https://aka.ms/PowerPlatformCLI).

**Without Microsoft Power Platform CLI tool this package should only be used for reference purposes.**
